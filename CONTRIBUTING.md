# Contributing

Thanks for considering a contribution!

## Development setup
- Use Docker + Compose v2.
- Python 3.10+ for generators/consumers.
- On Windows, prefer WSL2.

## Commit style
- Small, focused commits.
- Conventional commits *recommended* (`feat:`, `fix:`, `docs:`, `chore:`...).

## Pull Requests
1. Fork and create a feature branch.
2. Run the stack locally; add/adjust tests if applicable.
3. Ensure `ruff`/`black` (Python) and `shellcheck` pass locally.
4. Update `README.md` and `VERSIONS.md` as needed.
5. Add entry to `CHANGELOG.md` (Unreleased section).

## Code of Conduct
Be respectful and inclusive. Disagreements are fine; harassment is not.
